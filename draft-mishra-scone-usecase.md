This document describes the Applicability and Manageability considerations for providing throughput guidance to
application endpoints. This guidance is specifically addressed within the context of telecommunications service
provider networks utilizing the Standard Communication with Network Elements (SCONE) protocol.

# Introduction

The SCONE protocol {{I-D.ietf-scone-protocol}} provides a signaling mechanism that enables on-path SCONE-capable
Network Elements to communicate the advisory maximum allowable bit rate to application endpoints, which is particularly
relevant for adaptive bit-rate applications. This document addresses the Applicability and Manageability
considerations for deploying the SCONE protocol within telecommunications service provider networks.

SCONE operates based on a UDP 4-tuple. Network Elements capable of rate limiting at this granularity can send
notifications of the advisory maximum allowable bit rate in each direction of the observed traffic. Such Network
Elements may also drop or delay packets within the corresponding UDP 4-tuple flows. This implies that
on-path SCONE-capable Network Elements (referred to as SCONE Network Elements in the rest of this document)
are assumed to have the following capabilities: detect and maintain UDP 4-tuple flows, be aware of or
configurable with rate-limiting policies, and identify flows that carry SCONE packets in order
to insert throughput advice into those packets.

In this document, on-path SCONE Network Elements are generally considered within the *access* portion of the
Telecommunications provider's network. However, multiple SCONE Network Elements may exist along a path
between the communicating peers. Depending on their configuration and roles they are likely to generate
different throughput advices for the SCONE enabled application traffic flows, especially when different
*access* technologies are in use. For example, the SCONE protocol in a wireless access network element
may operate differently from one in a fixed broadband network. Wi-Fi networks provide another example,
where enforcement is often per user or per Service Set Identifier (SSID), but visibility into individual
UDP 4-tuples may be limited. Among access networks, mobile networks offer the most fine-grained
visibility into traffic flows and can act on individual flows. For example, in mobile networks, the User Plane
Function (UPF) in 5G {{5G-Arch}} and the Packet Data Network Gateway (P-GW) in 4G {{4G-Arch}} can generate throughput advice
to guide adaptive bit-rates applications on a per-flow basis. In contrast, wireline broadband networks typically
apply rate limiting at a centralized Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) or at aggregation points serving
multiple Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) devices.

Accordingly, Applicability and Manageability considerations must encompass a wide range of access-network
scenarios, each of which handles per-flow rate limiting differently. However, the scope of this document is limited
to discussing the core Applicability and Manageability considerations for the SCONE protocol.

# Terms and Definitions

This document uses terms and definitions described in {{I-D.ietf-scone-protocol}}.

# Applicability and Manageability Considerations

## Flow session awareness
SCONE signaling operates only over established sessions. SCONE Network Elements
ought to be able to unambiguously associate throughput advice with
application flows. Each session is bound to an IP address and port,
ensuring SCONE packets are routed precisely without affecting unrelated traffic.

## Per-Flow Signaling
Throughput advice is applied on a UDP 4-tuple basis. SCONE Network Elements
ought to maintain flow-specific context to ensure signaling correctness.
This enables applications to receive targeted throughput advice while
preventing unintended impact on unrelated flows.

## QoS awareness
Quality of Service (QoS) may be enforced by networks through a variety of 
mechanisms. In certain deployments, network operators may choose to apply distinct 
QoS policies to SCONE-enabled flows. The SCONE Network Element 
responsible for inserting SCONE advice is not required to interpret or 
enforce QoS policies; its role is limited to the signaling of the advisory 
throughput information. It is expected that network operators shall be able to identify 
SCONE-enabled flows and, where appropriate, provide throughput advice in accordance 
to their policy objectives.

## SCONE Hint to the Network
SCONE-aware applications ought to provide hints to the SCONE Network Elements,
enabling it to generate appropriate throughput advice for a given
UDP 4-tuple. Such hints prevent unnecessary default rate-limiting, allow the
network to signal the maximum allowable bit rate, and reduce CPU
overhead by eliminating additional classification steps.

## Retransmission of Advised Bit-Rate
Packet loss or non-delivery of SCONE advice reduces its effectiveness. Both
SCONE Network Elements and application endpoints should support retransmission or
periodic re-sending of SCONE packets to ensure reliable delivery.
Conformance depends on the behavior of both network and application endpoint.

## Frequency of Updates
The rate at which SCONE updates are issued depends on flow
characteristics and available computational resources. Excessively
frequent updates may increase CPU load, while infrequent updates may
reduce advisory effectiveness. Network Operators can define
adjustable update intervals based on application requirements, network
capacity, and operational constraints.

## Dynamic Updates
Dynamic rate limits updates can be enforced by the network during active
application sessions due to:

- Changes in access network type (requiring updated throughput advice)
- Changes in Subscriber policy (e.g., exceeding usage thresholds)

In such cases, the SCONE Network Elements need to be able to initiate SCONE
packets to provide updated advice, or applications should generate SCONE
packets frequently enough to trigger network responses.

## Monitoring and Logging
SCONE signaling can be integrated into existing operational and
management frameworks to enable monitoring, troubleshooting, and fault
isolation. Metrics of interest include:

- Rate of SCONE advisory messages issued per session
- Correlation between SCONE advisories and user-plane throughput changes
- Error conditions where SCONE signaling fails to reach the intended endpoints

## Conformance Monitoring
Networks providing SCONE throughput advice ought to implement
mechanisms to measure compliance, either per application flow or in
aggregate. This allows operators to validate advisory effectiveness and
adjust policies. Due to flow awareness, such mechanisms are typically
implemented in a SCONE Network Element but may also be implemented
elsewhere in the network.

## Standards Compliance
SCONE signaling is expected to traverse the existing data path associated
with the UDP 4-tuple flow for which the Network Element intends to send the advisory bit-rate.

## Interworking with Other Congestion Management Mechanisms
SCONE operates independently of transport-layer mechanisms such as
Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) or Low Latency, Low Loss, and
Scalable throughput (L4S). Operators would benefit from harmonizing multiple
congestion signaling methods by policy or scope deployments to manage
conflicting feedback.
